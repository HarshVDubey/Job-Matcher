Spring Health is a comprehensive mental health solution for employers and health plans. Unlike any other solution, we use clinically validated technology called Precision Mental Healthcare to pinpoint and deliver exactly what will work for each person — whether that’s meditation, coaching, therapy, medication, and beyond...

Today, Spring Health equips over 800 companies, from start-ups to multinational Fortune 500 corporations, as a leading and preferred mental health service. Companies like General Mills, Guardian, Bain, and Instacart use the Spring Health platform to provide mental health services to thousands of their team members globally. We have raised over $300 million from prominent investors including Kinnevik, Tiger Global, Northzone, RRE Ventures, Rethink Impact, Work-Bench, William K Warren Foundation, SemperVirens, Able Partners, True Capital Ventures, and a strategic investor, Guardian Life Insurance. Thanks to their partnership, our current valuation has reached $2 billion.

We are looking for a Senior Data Scientist to drive analytics efforts targeted at enhancing end user experience within Spring Health's software applications. You will be embedded in a product development team focusing on member activation which ensures that Spring Health benefit-eligible employees embark on their mental health journey in the most appropriate and effective way. In this role, you will help your team to uncover and prioritize new product opportunities and make impact across the entire initiative launch cycle - from experiment and data collection design to synthesizing actionable learnings and possible next steps post-launch.

What you’ll be doing day-to-day:
• Participate in strategic discussions and continuous refinement of the concept for the best-in-class early mental health journey experience and member-caregiver alliance
• Collaborate with product development and member marketing leads on defining key indicators of the quality of our member activation and uncovering opportunities to improve the user experience
• Ideate and design A/B tests to evaluate new product features and member communications
• Define product telemetry that enables seamless reporting and analysis
• Build necessary data models and insightful, automated dashboards to monitor and root-cause key product metrics trends
• Actively participate in prioritization and roadmapping discussions
• Lean into appropriate advanced methods, from advanced experimentation techniques to causal inference and statistical modeling, for deep-dive analyses around member engagement patterns
• Participate in the development of data-centric product features like search and personalized recommendations

What we expect from you:
• 5+ years of professional experience in a data role (data analyst, product analyst, data scientist, or similar), and at least 2 years of experience working with and defining product or growth metrics
• Hands-on experience with experimentation or hypothesis testing
• Previous exposure to product development/design process in the context of a software product
• Proficiency with SQL and experience with Python or R
• Comfort with wrangling telemetry/event logs data
• Experience working with BI tools (e.g. Looker, Tableau, Metabase) and product analytics SaaS tools (e.g. Mixpanel, Amplitude, Heap, etc.)
• Excellent verbal and written communication skills to guide and make recommendations to technical and non-technical business users
• Proven ability to proactively manage your own priorities and dependencies in alignment with cross-functional dependencies and product/business impact in a fast-paced environment
• Passion for successfully navigating ambiguous problem areas and learning new approaches
• General willingness to occasionally travel (at least 1x/year) to NYC for collaborative sessions/offsites with the team

What we’d love to see (bonus):
